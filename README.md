JuliesCommentTracker
====================

A test with F# and canopy that lists the comments on Julie Lermans Data Point articles


To make canopy run you need chromedriver (http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) in c:/  or possibly it works if you run with FF without a driver.

The results are found in results.txt inside the bin folder. 

First column is the comment count and the second one is date of the last comment. The text file displys fine in a text editor more capable than notepad.
